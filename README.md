A Chrome extension to export data via a CSV file from a Trello board.

It's available at the
[Chrome Extension Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/csv-for-trello/nlclhmcmfjpmmngpopdgapiccfddfagi).

## Usage

1. Install the extension
2. When you are at a Trello board, click the extension icon (on the right of the
